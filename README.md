# Gradient-Descent-Animation.


**Overview:**
This R script demonstrates the process of gradient descent for linear regression through an animation. Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in machine learning models. In this animation, we visualize how the algorithm iteratively adjusts the parameters (slope and intercept) of a linear regression model to minimize the cost function and improve the fit of the model to the data.

##Description:
1. Setup: The script begins by loading necessary libraries (`ggplot2` and `gifski`) and setting up the environment.
2. Gradient Descent Animation Function:** This section defines the `gradient_descent_animation` function, which takes input data (`x` and `y`), learning rate (`alpha`), and number of iterations (`num_iterations`). Inside the function, gradient descent is performed to optimize the parameters of the linear regression model.
3. Plotting Cost Function: The cost function's history is plotted against the number of iterations to visualize how it decreases over time as the model improves.
4. Model Visualization: The original data points and the predicted values by the linear regression model are plotted to visualize the fit of the model to the data.
5. Animation Generation:Frames for the animation are generated using the `gradient_descent_animation` function. Each frame represents a different iteration of the gradient descent algorithm, showing the progression of the model's parameters towards convergence.
6. Exporting Animation: The frames are exported as PNG files and then converted into a GIF using the `gifski` package. The resulting GIF provides a dynamic visualization of the gradient descent process.

##Running the Script:
To run the script with your own data:
- Replace `x` and `y` with your input data.
- Adjust the learning rate (`alpha`) and number of iterations (`num_iterations`) as needed.
- Ensure that the required libraries (`ggplot2` and `gifski`) are installed and loaded.

##Example Usage:
In the provided example, random data is generated for demonstration purposes. You can replace this with your own dataset and adjust the parameters accordingly.

##Note:
- This script serves as a visual aid for understanding gradient descent in linear regression and may require modifications for other types of models or datasets.
- For optimal visualization, it's recommended to adjust the parameters and data based on your specific use case.
