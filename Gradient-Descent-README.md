# Gradient Descent Animation

### **What is Gradient Descent?**
**Gradient descent** is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent, as defined by the negative of the gradient. In machine learning, it is often used to minimize the cost function and improve model performance.

### **What is Linear Regression?**
**Linear regression** is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). It assumes a linear relationship between variables and predicts outcomes using a straight line, defined by the equation:  

\[
y = \theta_0 + \theta_1 \cdot x
\]

Linear regression is widely used in fields like economics, biology, and machine learning to predict trends, analyze relationships, and model data.

### **Why Use These Techniques?**
- **Gradient Descent**: Helps find the optimal parameters (slope and intercept) that minimize the error in the model. 
- **Linear Regression**: Provides a simple and interpretable way to predict outcomes or identify trends based on input variables.

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **Step 1: Initialize the Environment**
We start by loading the necessary libraries and setting up the data:
```R
library(ggplot2)
library(gifski)

set.seed(123)
x <- iris$Sepal.Length  # Independent variable
y <- iris$Petal.Length  # Dependent variable
```

#### **Step 2: Define the Gradient Descent Function**
This function performs gradient descent, computes cost function values, and stores regression line coefficients for animation:
```R
gradient_descent_animation <- function(x, y, alpha = 0.01, num_iterations = 1000) {
  # Function body (same as provided earlier)
}
```

#### **Step 3: Visualize the Cost Function**
The cost function shows how the error decreases over iterations:
```R
results <- gradient_descent_animation(x, y, alpha = 0.01, num_iterations = 1000)
plot(1:1000, results$cost_history, type = "l", xlab = "Iteration", ylab = "Cost")
```

#### **Step 4: Generate the Animation**
Create frames for each iteration and combine them into a GIF:
```R
png_files <- sprintf("frame%03d.png", 1:32)
iters <- seq(1, 1000, length.out = 32)

for (i in 1:length(iters)) {
  # Generate animation frames
}
gifski(png_files, gif_file = "gradient_descent_animation.gif", delay = 0.4)
unlink(png_files)
```
